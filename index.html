        It is an information retrieval system that allows users to search for information on the Internet in hypertext and multimedia environments. It is the most widely available system worldwide that effectively searches for various information on the Internet expressed in hypertext format.[1]

    Hypertext can be seen as a way to read pieces of information from a web server, such as "documents" or Web pages, and print them out on a computer monitor through a program called a web browser. Users can then follow the hyperlinks on each page to another document or send a series of information to the server that is serving the page. The act of moving along a hyperlink is often referred to as web surfing (web surfing, cultural language: Mangyuram [2]), or web browsing. And a collection of web pages with related content is called a Web site.

    The English word worldwide is usually used as one word without a space or hyphen, but the World Wide Web and its abbreviation WWW are used as official English words.

    The World Wide Web can be summarized into three features: How to position the first unified Web resource, e.g. URL. Protocol access to the resource name of the second Web. e.g. HTTP, language that can easily navigate between resources, e.g. HTML.[3]
