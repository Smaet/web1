      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <p>JavaScript (English: JavaScript) is an object-based scripting language. The language is mainly used within web browsers and has the ability to access embedded objects in other applications. It is also used in server side network programming, such as in runtime environments such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation under the name Mocha and later under the name LiveScript, which eventually became JavaScript. While JavaScript is similar to Sun Microsystems' Java syntax, it is actually because both languages are based on the basic syntax of C language, Java and JavaScript are not directly related. Aside from the name and syntax, there are many similarities to self- or skimming than Java.

As of January 2013, the latest version is JavaScript 1.8.5 and [3], supported by Firefox 3. The JavaScript version corresponding to the standard ECMA-262 3rd edition is 1.5. The ECMAscript is simply a standardized version of JavaScript. The release of Mozilla 1.8 Beta 1 partially supported E4X (ECMA-357), an extended language corresponding to XML. JavaScript has different versions supported by each browser.</p>
