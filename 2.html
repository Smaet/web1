        Dependent sheets or cascading style sheets (CSSs) are mainly used in [1], HTML and XHml as languages that describe how the Markup language is actually displayed, and can also be used in XML. It is a standard for W3C and has a high degree of freedom when defining layout and style.
If the Markup language is the body of a website, CSS is responsible for decorating such as clothes and accessories. That is, if you leave the HTML structure intact and change only the CSS file, you can decorate it like a completely different website.
For the CSS3 currently under development, the ability to replace images produced by graphic editing programs such as shadow effects, gradations, and deformation has been added. In addition, a variety of animation features have been added to some extent to replace Adobe Flash.
